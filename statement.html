        <p class="lead color">Our Mission Statement:</p>
        <p class="color">Pierre Investigations is a nonprofit  investigations company in California striving to achieve results that exceed our clients expectations and industry standards by employing highly experienced private investigators that follow four basic principles; Professionalism, Accountability, Integrity, and Confidentially.</p>
        <p class="color mission"><span>Professionalism:</span> To provide exceptional investigative services to our clients by employing the most innovative investigative methods available.  The conduct of our private investigators will always be of the highest ethical and moral standards.  As our client, you will be treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.</p>
        <p class="color mission"><span>Accountability:</span> Contracting with a private investigator typically means that you are experiencing a stressful situation and are in search of a solution. The investigative firm you contract with should not add to that anxiety.  We vow to be accessible and maintain quality communications to answer all your questions and to report only the most accurate and available information in existence at the time of the service. If there is ever a question regarding our conduct or services we will do everything we can to verify and remedy the situation.</p>
        <p class="color mission"><span>Integrity:</span> Integrity can be defined as, “doing the right thing, even if no one is looking.”  We pledge to hold our private investigators, investigative techniques, and services performed to the highest standards of integrity and honesty found in the private detective and security industry.  We will be forthcoming and truthful in all aspects of our business. We guarantee that organizational work ethics are complied with in accordance with federal, state and local laws.  Our extreme adherence to procedure allows us to ensure your privacy and confidentiality.</p>
        <p class="color mission"><span>Confidentiality:</span> All investigations conducted by Pierre Investigations for our clients are held STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL between our clients and us. Any information we gather resulting from an investigation will "ONLY" be turned over to our client for their exclusive use, unless our client gives us written consent authorizing us to turn the information over to a third party such as their attorney.</p>
        <p class="lead">

        <div class="statement color">
          <p>
          Pierre Investigations will "Never" give a client's personal information to anyone and all investigations are discreetly conducted by one of our experienced private investigators. We do understand that some cases can be embarrassing so we want you, "our client", to know that your free consultation is held "Strictly Confidential".
          </p>
          
          <p>            
          At Pierre Investigations we also understand the sensitive and confidential nature of the cases we work on.  Preserving the confidentiality of our clients and conducting investigation in a discrete manner is the foundation of our case work.  We are committed to the principles of loyalty, honesty, and confidentiality.  We do not compromise on those principles.  There are so many elements of the investigative process that are out of our control, but confidentiality, professionalism and honesty are within the scope of our abilities and we guarantee our clients those virtues.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          At Pierre Investigations, our number one priority is serving the needs of our customers in an honest, ethical manner.  In order to exist as a company, we are dependent upon our customers and their goals become our goals.  Ultimately, our success as an investigation firm is directly related and contingent upon our client’s success.  As a result, our field investigators and office staff conduct every investigation with the belief and mindset that the client’s objective and our objective are one in the same. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          As a company, Pierre Investigations is made up of individual team members.  From our office staff and managers to our field investigators, we realize that loyalty to each other is just as essential as our loyalty to our customers.  We realize that mistakes may happen and what matters most is how we deal with those mistakes both internally (within the company) and externally (with our customers).  Together, we make it right!!!  As we stand by our employees and staff members, they will in turn, stand by the company.    We understand that the company is made up of individuals and the firm is a direct reflection of our investigative team.  
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Finally, we consider Private Investigations to be the greatest business in the world.  We enjoy the creative nature of our job and accept the challenge of our cases.  Private Investigative work is a unique business that offers something different almost every day.  We are optimistic, positive and passionate about our work.  We recognize that this will ultimately lead to greater success in the cases we work on and, in turn, lead to the success of the firm.  
          Our goal is to accomplish our client’s goals and in doing so, we believe that the objectives of the company and the investigative staff will be met.
